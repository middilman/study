programming computers
    you need a basis for telling a computer what to do
        that's a programming language

    what are some examples of standards we use to communicate with each other?
        musical notes
        facial expressions
        early on, knots

    what if you only had rocks to communicate with someone?
        say you live in a cave, and when you leave, someone else comes. So, you're there in
        shifts. All you have to leave a message with is rocks. How would you communicate a
        number with rocks?
        3?
        13?
        310?

    do exactly what they are told
    only understand flawless instructions
    only read 1s and 0s

people are smart

        read
        know numbers
        standards (brown sugar is packed)

        human being
            humans substitute apples
            don't follow recipes
            can't convey the instructions

        inexact
            wing it
            fly by the seat of your pants
            guestimate
            eyeball it

        why do humans estimate?

pseudocode
    meta programming language

comments are for people, ignored by computers
    annotations


so, what does it mean to program a computer?
    create instructions
    in a language the computer understands
    give the computer the instructions
    ask the computer to run the instructions
